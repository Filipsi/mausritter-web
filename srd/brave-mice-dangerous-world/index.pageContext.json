You and between two and five friends play make-believe to create a shared world. The rules help keep the story you tell consistent, interesting and challenging.\n\nOne of you will take on the role of the Game Master (GM). They will invent and describe a consistent, believable world, complete with dangerous antagonists, wild lands, and friendly settlements. They will also act as a neutral referee of the rules, applying them fairly to player mice, along with the non-player characters within the world.\n\nThe other players take on the role of the mice. They each play the role of a small, brave and desperate adventurer, delving into dangerous places and exploring the world that the GM describes.\n\n### What is a role-playing game?\n\nRole-playing games are a process of shared, collaborative storytelling and problem solving.\nRole-playing games exist mostly as a conversation. The GM will describe a situation, and the players will describe how the mice they control react and interact with it.\n\nAt certain points (such as when a mouse does something risky), the rules of the game interject. Dice may be rolled to see what happens. Then the conversation resumes.\n\n## What you need to play\n\n- A character sheet for each player\n- A session tracking sheet for the Game Master\n- A set of Item and Condition tokens\n- Polyhedral gaming dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 and d20)\n- Pencils and erasers\n- Spare paper for taking notes and sketching maps\n\n### Dice notation\n\nMausritter uses standard RPG dice notation throughout.\n\nFor example:\n\n- d20 means: Roll a single 20-sided die\n- 1d8 means: Roll a single 8-sided die\n- 3d6 means: Roll three 6-sided dice, add them together\n\nFor a d3 or d2, roll a 6-sided die and divide by two or three.\n","filename":"10-brave-mice-dangerous-world.md"},"downloadUrl":"/srd/mausritter-srd-2.3.md"}}
