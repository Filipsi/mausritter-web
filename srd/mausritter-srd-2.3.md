# Brave mice in a dangerous world

## What is Mausritter?

Mausritter is a role-playing game. You and between two and five friends play make-believe to create a shared world. The rules help keep the story you tell consistent, interesting and challenging.

One of you will take on the role of the Game Master (GM). They will invent and describe a consistent, believable world, complete with dangerous antagonists, wild lands, and friendly settlements. They will also act as a neutral referee of the rules, applying them fairly to player mice, along with the non-player characters within the world.

The other players take on the role of the mice. They each play the role of a small, brave and desperate adventurer, delving into dangerous places and exploring the world that the GM describes.

### What is a role-playing game?

Role-playing games are a process of shared, collaborative storytelling and problem solving.
Role-playing games exist mostly as a conversation. The GM will describe a situation, and the players will describe how the mice they control react and interact with it.

At certain points (such as when a mouse does something risky), the rules of the game interject. Dice may be rolled to see what happens. Then the conversation resumes.

## What you need to play

- A character sheet for each player
- A session tracking sheet for the Game Master
- A set of Item and Condition tokens
- Polyhedral gaming dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 and d20)
- Pencils and erasers
- Spare paper for taking notes and sketching maps

### Dice notation

Mausritter uses standard RPG dice notation throughout.

For example:

- d20 means: Roll a single 20-sided die
- 1d8 means: Roll a single 8-sided die
- 3d6 means: Roll three 6-sided dice, add them together

For a d3 or d2, roll a 6-sided die and divide by two or three.


# Make a mouse

The world is very big and very dangerous for a small mouse adventurer. You will need to be very brave, and always keep your wits about you.

Use these procedures to create a new mouse adventurer, or use the [instant mouse generator](https://mausritter.com/mouse) for even faster character creation.

## 1. Attributes

Your mouse has three attribute scores. These measure their basic strengths and weaknesses.

- **STR:** physical strength and resilience.
- **DEX:** speed and agility.
- **WIL:** strength of will and charisma.

For each of these attributes, in order, roll **3d6**.

Keep the **two highest dice** results for a value between 2—12.

You may then swap any two attributes.

## 2. HP, pips and background

**Roll d6** for your **Hit Protection** (HP). This is the damage your mouse can shrug off before taking serious harm.

**Roll d6** for your mouse’s starting **pips**. These are the basic currency of the mouse kingdom.

**Cross reference** the value of your **HP** with your **pips** on the **Background table**. This is what your mouse was before becoming an adventurer.

## 3. Starting equipment

Your mouse starts with:

- **Torches**
- **Rations**
- Two items from their **background**
- A **weapon** of your choice (see p. 9)

If your mouse’s highest attribute is 9 or less, roll on the Background table again and take either Item A or B. If your highest is 7 or less, take both.

## 4. Details

Roll or choose **birthsign**, **coat** and a **physical detail**.

Choose a **name** appropriate for a brave mouse.

# Inventory

## Inventory slots

Your mouse carries items in their inventory slots. Most items take up one inventory slot. Some larger items, such as two-handed weapons and armour take up two slots.

### Paw slots

Your mouse has two paw slots.

Items in these slots are carried.

### Body slots

Your mouse has two body slots.

Worn items can be swapped with paw slots as a free action.

### Pack slots

Your mouse has six body slots.

Items in these slots take time to retrieve when under pressure. While in combat, your mouse must use an action (instead of attacking) to find an item in their pack.

## Conditions

Conditions are **negative effects** suffered by your mouse. Each Condition must be placed in an **inventory slot**. Mice may have multiple copies of the same condition.

Some Conditions have additional effects, which apply as long as the Condition remains in your inventory.

Conditions can only be **removed** by meeting their **clear** requirement—usually a short, long or full rest.

## Usage

Most items have three **usage dots**. When all three dots are marked on an item it is depleted or destroyed. Usage dots can be cleared from weapons/armour for 10% of the original cost per dot cleared.

- **Weapons/armour/ammunition:** after a fight, roll d6 for each item that was used during the fight. On 4-6, mark usage.
- **Torches/lanterns:** mark usage every 6 Turns.
- **Rations:** mark usage after a meal.
- **Other gear:** if used in a way that could break or deplete it, the GM may ask you to mark usage.

## Encumbrance

If your mouse is carrying more items or Conditions than available inventory slots, they are **encumbered**.

While encumbered, your mouse cannot **run**, and makes all saves with **Disadvantage**.

## Banking

In a mouse settlement, pips and items can be stored in a bank or safebox.

Your mouse must pay a fee of 1% of the value when retrieving the stored pips or items.

## Essential items

### Torches and lanterns

Lanterns must be refilled by oil.

Electric lanterns must be recharged by batteries, but provide 6 usage dots instead of 3.

### Rations

**Food for the road**

Eating a ration and spending a Watch resting will heal all HP.

If your mouse doesn’t eat for a day, they gain a Hungry Condition.

### Pip purse

**Holds 250 pips**

Carried pips require one inventory slot per 250, barring the first 250, which are carried in your mouse’s pockets.

Mice in settlements mostly deal in barter and IOUs, and pips can be stored at a bank.


# How to play

The GM describes a situation. You describe what your mouse does. The GM will describe the outcome. The conversation flows until the mechanics interject.

## Role-playing

You are in control of—and acting in the role of—your mouse. You can talk in first, second or third person, or switch between them. You don’t have to do a silly voice, but it certainly can’t hurt.

## Best practices

If you’re stuck thinking of what to do when you’re playing Mausritter, refer back to these guidelines.

- **Ask lots of questions.** Make notes. Draw maps.
- **Work together.** Devise schemes. Recruit allies.
- **Dice are dangerous.** Clever plans don’t need to roll.
- **Play to win.** Delight in losing.
- **Fight dirty.** Run. Die. Roll a new mouse.

## Saves

When you describe your mouse doing something **risky** where the outcome is **uncertain** and failure has **consequences**, the GM will ask you to make a save against either STR, DEX or WIL.

To make a save, roll a d20. If the result is **less than or equal** to the relevant attribute, your mouse succeeds, and suffers no consequences. If the result is over the attribute, your mouse fails, and suffers the consequences described by the GM.

### Opposed saves

If your mouse and another character are competing, you both make saves. The **lowest successful roll** wins.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If you roll a save and are particularly well prepared or equipped, the GM may allow you to roll with **Advantage**. Roll **2d20** and take the **lowest** result.

The GM may ask you to roll with **Disadvantage** if you are in bad position or poorly equipped for your current task. Roll **2d20** and take the **highest** result.

## Combat

Combat is dangerous business for mice, even brave adventurers. But sometimes it cannot be avoided.

If you attack **unsuspecting** foes, your mouse and any allies aware of the plan **go first**. Otherwise, make a **DEX save** to act before your opponents. In following combat rounds, maintain this order.

On your turn in a combat Round, your mouse can **move** up to 12" and perform an **action**. Actions can anything from negotiating, attacking, fleeing or performing a risky gambit (like tripping or disarming an opponent).

### Attacks

**Attacks always hit.** Roll your weapon’s die and do that much damage to an opponent, minus their armour.

When an attack is **impaired**, such is firing into cover, or fighting while grappled, roll **d4** for damage regardless of weapon. When an attack is **enhanced** by a gambit or vulnerable opponent, roll **d12**.

### Hit Protection and damage

Damage is dealt first to a creature’s **Hit Protection** (HP). This represents the creature’s ability to avoid or shrug off real damage.

Once HP is depleted, damage is dealt to **STR**.

After taking STR damage, the creature must make a STR save. If they succeed, they are still able to fight. If they fail, they take critical damage.

When a creature takes **critical damage**, they take an **Injured** Condition, and are **incapacitated** until tended to by an ally and take a short rest.

If an incapacitated creature is left untended for 6 exploration **Turns**, they die.

### Attribute score loss and death

If a creature has their **STR** reduced to zero, they are **dead**. If **DEX** is reduced to zero, they are **unable to move**. If **WIL** is reduced to zero, they are reduced to **insensibility**.

When your mouse **dies**, roll up a new one. The GM should introduce them as soon as possible. Getting back into the game quickly is more important than realism.

## Rest and healing

There are three ways your mouse can rest and recover.

- **Short rest:** takes 1 Turn. A swig of water and a few minutes of rest will restore **d6+1 HP**.
- **Long rest:** takes 1 Watch. A meal and some sleep will restore **all HP**. If HP was already full, restore **d6** to an **attribute score**.
- **Full rest:** takes a week back in safety. This **fully restores** your mouse’s ability scores and removes most long-term Conditions. A week of food and board in a settlement usually costs 20p.

## Time

For convenience and ease of reference, game time is divided up into three time scales of expanding duration.

- **Round:** the timescale used during **combat**. Each Round is less than a minute.
- **Turn:** the timescale used during **adventure site exploration**. Each Turn is around 10 minutes, and is enough time to explore one room or perform an action or two. A fight will almost always last one Turn.
- **Watch:** the timescale used during **wilderness travel**. Each Watch is 36 Turns, about 6 hours. There are 4 watches in a day. You can usually travel 1 hex or mile in a watch.

## Overland travel

Your party of mice can travel **one hex** or mile per **Watch**. **Difficult terrain** (streams, human roads, large rocks, hills, etc.) require **two Watches** per mile traveled.

### Foraging

In the wild, your mouse can spend a Watch **foraging**.

If they do, they will find **d3 uses** of **rations**.

## Advancement

Your mouse earns Experience Points (XP) by bringing **treasure** and useful goods back from **places of danger** to the safety of a **mouse settlement**.

For every pip-worth of treasure brought to safety (divided equally amongst the party), your mouse earns 1 XP.

Your mouse can earn **additional XP** by **spending** their pips **selflessly** on improvements for the whole community. For every 10 pips spent this way, your mouse earns 1 XP.

### Level

Mice start at Level 1.

The following table shows the total XP required to advance each Level.

| Level | Hit Dice | Grit | Experience points |
| ----- | -------- | ---- | ----------------- |
| 1     | 1d6      | 0    | 0                 |
| 2     | 2d6      | 1    | 1000              |
| 3     | 3d6      | 2    | 3000              |
| 4     | 4d6      | 2    | 6000              |
| 5+    | 4d6      | 3    | +5000             |

When your mouse earns enough XP to advance to each Level, use the following procedure.

- **Roll for attribute increase:** roll d20 once for each of your mouse’s STR, DEX and WIL. If a result is higher than the attribute’s current value, increase it by one.
- **Roll Hit Dice:** roll the dice listed for the new Level’s Hit Dice. If the value is higher than your mouse’s current HP, replace your HP with the rolled value. Otherwise, increase your mouse’s HP by 1.

### Grit

Starting at second Level, your mouse has **Grit**. This allows your mouse to **ignore Conditions**.

For each point of Grit you have, you may place one Condition into the Grit space on your character sheet. Once placed into the Grit space, a Condition cannot be removed until cleared.


# Magic

## Spells

Spells are living spirits trapped by runes carved on obsidian tablets. Spells are usually found in deep and dangerous places. The creation of spells is an art lost to all but the most learned wizards, and they guard their secrets closely.

### Selling spells

If unwanted, a fully charged spell can usually be sold for d6 x 100p in a settlement. A depleted spell’s value is halved.

### Casting a spell

To cast a spell, your mouse must hold the tablet in a paw and read it aloud.

When your mouse casts a spell, decide on the **power** to cast it with, up to the number of usage dots remaining on the spell.

Roll a number of **d6** equal to the **power** the spell is cast with. For each die which shows the **value 4, 5 or 6**, mark one usage on the spell.

The spell has an **effect**, which varies depending on the number of **[DICE]** invested, and the **[SUM]** of the rolled dice.

### Recharging a spell

When a spell’s usage dots are filled, it is **depleted** and cannot be cast. Each spell has a **recharge requirement**. Fulfilling this requirement will coax the spirit back to the spell and **clear all** of its usage dots.

### Miscasts

Whenever **one or more 6s** are rolled when casting a spell, the caster takes **d6 damage to WIL** for each 6 rolled. Then make a WIL save. If failed, take the **Drained** Condition.

## List of spells

Roll on this table of spells as loot, or use these spells as examples for creating your own.

# Recruiting help

A pair of helping paws might give you the edge you’ll need to survive. Throughout the mouse kingdoms you’ll come across other mice who are willing to explore the vast unknown world with you and your party.

## Hirelings

In a mouse settlement, you can spend a day asking around for mice looking for work. The size of the settlement determines what types of hireling are available. Smaller settlements may not have skilled mice looking for work.

### Recruiting hirelings

Make a **WIL save** or **pay** 20p. If successful (or 20p is paid), roll the **Number** for the type of hireling you are interested in employing to determine how many are looking for work.

Typical hirelings will have:  
d6 hp, STR 2d6, DEX 2d6, WIL 2d6

Hirelings have 6 inventory slots: two paw, two body, two pack.

| Hireling            | Number | Wages/day |
| ------------------- | ------ | --------- |
| Torchbearer         | d6     | 1p        |
| Labourer            | d6     | 2p        |
| Tunnel digger       | d4     | 5p        |
| Armourer/blacksmith | d2     | 8p        |
| Local guide         | d4     | 10p       |
| Mouse-at-arms       | d6     | 10p       |
| Scholar             | d2     | 20p       |
| Knight              | d3     | 25p       |
| Interpreter         | d2     | 30p       |

### Hireling morale

When a hireling or warband is placed in a **stressful situation**, made to go without pay or food, or asked to do something more **dangerous** than what they signed on for, they must make a **WIL save** or **flee**.

Especially well-paid or loyal hirelings may make this save with Advantage.

### Hireling advancement

Hirelings and warbands can improve in the same way that your player mice do.

- Hirelings who receive a share of treasure gain 1 XP per pip they are given above their daily wage.
- Warbands who receive share of treasure will gain 1 XP per 10 pips they are given above their weekly wage.

Hirelings and warbands advance at the same rate as player mice, so once they get 1000 XP, they advance to Level 2.

Not receiving a share of treasure may cause resentment amongst hirelings.

## Warbands

A mouse is very small, and many beasts cannot be defeated working alone. When mice work together, they can form a warband, and act on a scale capable of facing other warbands or large beasts, like a cat or boar.

### Forming a warband

A warband is formed by 20 or more fighting mice, plus one follower (luggage porter, cook, armourer) for every fighter.

Your mouse can form a warband under their command. In a town or city, spend a week recruiting. Make a WIL save or pay 1000p.

Warbands start with:  
d6 hp, STR 10, DEX 10, WIL 10  
Damage: d6 clubs and axes

Warbands require 1000p a week for upkeep and wages. Failure to pay may result in mutiny.

### Battles

Battles between warbands and warband-scale creatures function the same as fights between small individuals. Attacks deal damage to HP, then to STR.

Attacks by a warband against a non-warband scale creature are enhanced, any damage taken from non-warband scale creatures is ignored unless it is particularly destructive or large scale.

### Casualties

When a warband takes critical damage, they are broken and cannot act until rallied. At STR 0 the warband is wiped out. At half STR, the warband must make a WIL save or be routed.

Warbands recover HP and attribute score damage like individuals do, with Short, Long and Full rests.

### Equipping

Equipment improves a warband’s abilities the same way as it does for individuals. Just multiply the purchase price by 20.

## Constructions

The **right to build** on land cannot be bought. It can only be given, or taken and defended.

A team of three tunnel diggers can excavate one 6" cube of soil per day. Other materials take twice as long.

Rooms can be of any size — the following is the cost of materials and fittings per 6" cube constructed. Labourers and diggers must be paid separately.

| Room                       | Cost  |
| -------------------------- | ----- |
| Tunnel, per 6"             | 10p   |
| Poor room, per 6" cube     | 100p  |
| Standard room, per 6" cube | 500p  |
| Grand room, per 6" cube    | 2000p |

All constructions require an **upkeep** of 1% of the total cost per month.

# Running Mausritter

## Best practices

The following are guidelines for playing the role of the Game Master for Mausritter.

### Make the world seem huge

Mice are small. Be on the lookout for opportunities to remind the players of the **small-scale characters** they are playing.

### Create situations, not plots

Let the players **find their own adventure**. Don’t railroad them onto a particular path. Give the players the space to choose the challenges they are interested in.

### Present the world honestly

As the GM, you are the **eyes, ears and nose** of the players and their mice. Don’t unnecessarily hide things from your players. Make sure they have all the information they need to make meaningful choices.

Make the world a **consistent**, understandable place. Don’t shy away from magic and weirdness, but maintain a logic behind it that can be decoded.

Be an **impartial arbiter** of the rules of the game and the world. Let the dice fall as they may. Follow the goals and actions of antagonists to their logical conclusion.

### Telegraph danger

Give the players ample **warning** of the **dangers** they face. Make traps obvious, deadly puzzles. Give warning of the dangerous beasts that hunt the mice.

Don’t pull your punches.

The only way for danger to be meaningful is if the outcome of failure is meaningful. When the players face off against dangerous foes, or fall into a deadly trap, do not shy away from the consequences.

### Reward bravery

When the players have been smart and brave and followed good leads, give them the **rewards** they have earned. Don’t be miserly when the players face down great dangers and succeed.

## Asking for a Save

Saves should only be asked for as the result of a player’s action or choice. Mice can do anything that seems reasonable and safe, but when they do something dangerous, ask for Save to avoid the possible consequences.

- **STR Saves:** avoid harm through physical power and endurance
- **DEX Saves:** avoid harm through quick reaction, speed and agility
- **WIL Saves:** avoid harm through strength of will and force of personality

### Consequences of failure

The consequences of a failed Save should obvious and telegraphed. Remember that Saves should only occur when a player wants to avoid a negative outcome.

Some options for consequences are:

- **Damage:** ranging from d4 to d20. d4 is minor, d6 is dangerous. d8 is enough to seriously injure a Level 1 character. d20 damage is rare but deadly.
- **Condition:** Exhausted or Frightened are good options.
- **Lost time:** Each action takes a Turn. Lost time can burn torches and cause random encounter rolls.
- **Loss of random item:** Roll d6 for inventory slot.
- **Mark usage on item:** Mark 1-3 usage dots.

## Luck rolls

Luck rolls are for events that have an unpredictable outcome is outside the remit of a STR, DEX or WIL Save. Assign an ‘X-in-6’ chance to the outcome occurring (low for unlikely, high for likely), then roll a d6. If the result is equal to or less than the chance, it happens.

## Rulings

The rules of Mausritter will not cover every situation you and the players come across, and some parts have been kept intentionally vague.

When this happens, **adapt** one of your existing tools to the purpose, or **create** a new one. Make a note of the ruling for future use.

## Exploration and time

When **exploring** in a dungeon or **adventure site**, a party of mice can perform **one major action per Turn**. Major actions are things like moving to a new room, examining a trap or engaging in a fight.

To easily record Turns, use the **Turn tracker** on the GM Session sheet. Each time the party performs a major action, mark the next empty box. When a double-outlined box is marked, roll for an encounter.

## Overland travel

When traveling in the wilderness, the mice can travel a single one-mile hex per Watch. Hexes containing difficult terrain (streams, human roads, large rocks, hills, etc.) require two Watches to cross.

### Rest

If the mice do not spend at least one Watch per day resting, give them an Exhausted Condition.

### Weather

Roll 2d6 for weather each day.

Weather that is highlighted are poor conditions for travel. For each Watch spent traveling under these conditions, a mouse must make a STR save or gain an Exhausted Condition.

| 2d6  | Spring           | Summer           | Autumn          | Winter          |
| ---- | ---------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 2    | Rain storm       | Thunder storm    | Wild winds      | Snow storm      |
| 3-5  | Drizzle          | Very hot         | Heavy rain      | Sleet           |
| 6-8  | Overcast         | Clear, hot       | Cool            | Bitter cold     |
| 9-11 | Bright and sunny | Pleasantly sunny | Patchy rain     | Overcast        |
| 12   | Clear and warm   | Beautifully warm | Clear and crisp | Clear and crisp |

## Encounters

When the mice are exploring a dungeon or **adventure site**, roll for encounters **every three Turns**, or whenever they create noise or mayhem that could draw attention.

When they are exploring the **wilderness**, roll for encounters at the start of the **Morning** Watch and the start of the **Evening** watch. If an encounter occurs, roll d12 to find what hour it occurs in.

To roll a random encounter, **roll d6**. On a 1, an **encounter** occurs. On a 2, an **omen** occurs (signs or hints of an encounter).

### Encounter tables

For each major area, prepare a table of d6 encounters that express the theme of that area. Give each entry something they are already doing as the players arrive.

- Entries 1-3 should be variations of a common encounter.
- Entries 4-5 should be variations of an uncommon encounter, something slightly unusual.
- Entry 6 should be a dangerous or weird encounter.

### Reactions

When the mice encounter a creature whose reaction to the party is not obvious, you may roll on the following table for their disposition.

| 2d6  | Reaction                                     |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 2    | **Hostile.** How have the mice angered them? |
| 3-5  | **Unfriendly.** How can they be appeased?    |
| 6-8  | **Unsure.** What could win them over?        |
| 9-11 | **Talkative.** What could they trade?        |
| 12   | **Helpful.** How can they help the mice?     |

### Morale

Whenever an antagonist is in a battle with the mice and reaches one of the following conditions, it must make a WIL save. On failure, the creature must flee or surrender.

- Is obviously outmatched at the start of a battle
- Takes critical damage for the first time
- Sees an ally flee or fall


# Creatures

## Language

As a general rule of thumb, the more closely related two creatures are, the more likely they are to understand each other. Magical or highly intelligent creatures may break these rules.

- Other **mice**: Can easily communicate.
- Other **rodents**: Can speak and communicate, with some difficulty and difference of custom.
- Other **mammals**: Make a WIL save to see if communication is possible.
- Otherwise: Can’t directly communicate.

## List of creatures

Use these creatures in your campaign, and as examples for creating new antagonists for your players.

When a creature lists critical damage in its stat block, this occurs instead of the standard critical damage effect.

> Example: a spider attacks Burdock the mouse and does 4 damage. The Burdock has 2 HP, so 2 of the damage is passed through to his DEX. Burdock must make a DEX Save, but fails, so the spider quickly wraps the him up in its web and starts to escape. Hopefully Burdock’s friends are quick in their pursuit!

# Hexcrawl toolbox

## Making a hexcrawl

### 1. Fill hexes

Start with a 5x5 map of **one-mile hexes**. Place a friendly **settlement** in the centre.

Fill the remaining hexes. Roll on the **hex contents** tables or use them as inspiration. Write a one-line description for each hex.

### 2. Create factions (Optional)

**Factions** are the major powers within your hex crawl. They help set the stakes of the players choices, and create the feeling of a living world going on outside of the game sessions.

### 3. Detail adventure sites

**Adventure sites** are the dangerous places where brave adventurers find the wealth they seek. Where settled mice, more careful and less desperate, do not dare to scurry.

Pick 2-4 of the of the landmarks and detail them as adventure sites. Spread them out, to give the players good reasons to criss-cross the map.

Decide the **theme** for each, then **fully detail** one of them. You can detail the others now, or wait until the players are closer to encountering them.

### 4. Seed rumours

Create a table of **d6 rumours**. As the players explore adventure sites or rest in settlements, use this table to give **hints** of other locations and of the activities of factions within the hexcrawl.

- Entries 1-3 should be true
- Entries 4-5 should partially true
- Entry 6 should be false

### 5. Create encounter table

Based on the factions you’ve chosen and other inhabitants of the area, create a table of **d6 encounters**.

## Running a hexcrawl

### First session

In the first session, pick one of the adventure sites you’ve detailed and start the players at the entrance.

Give the players a reason why they should care about the adventure site. Use the backgrounds of their mice and theme of the adventure site as hooks, or use the table below if you’re stuck for ideas.

| d6  | Starting adventure site hook                      |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Searching for a lost family member                |
| 2   | Investigating on orders of a noblemouse           |
| 3   | Mouse wizard requires a certain spell component   |
| 4   | Site is lair of a creature harassing a settlement |
| 5   | Following an inherited treasure map               |
| 6   | Seeking shelter from a terrible storm             |

### Exploring the map

Once the players are done exploring the adventure site, or need to retreat back to a friendly place for supplies, show them a **blank version** of your map.

Mark the **friendly settlement** and the **adventure site**, plus a couple of other well-known places.

Allow the players to find their own way through the map. As the party of mice move through each hex, they should automatically encounter the major landmarks you’ve created, as long as they are fairly obvious.

### Expanding the map

As the players uncover new leads and the world changes around them, create some more adventure sites and start expanding the map.

## Hex contents

For each hex on your map, roll, choose or invent:

- Hex type
- Landmark (depending on hex type)
- An interesting detail for that landmark

Write a one-line description for each hex.

### Hex type

| d6  | Type        |

Most mouse settlements are no more than a handful of families in an oak hollow or in an old farmhouse wall.

## Factions

Factions are **large forces** outside the control of the player mice. They help create a feeling of a **living world**.

Pick or create 3-4 factions to be the major powers within your hexcrawl.

### Using factions

Factions have goals they are trying to complete and resources they can utilise towards the goal’s completion. Goals should interact with other factions or complete for similar resources.

**Resources** reflect the power and influence of the faction within the world.

Each **goal** requires 2-5 progress marks (eg. ○○) to be completed, depending on its complexity.

Factions with at least three resources are capable of fielding a warband.

### Goal progression

**Between sessions**, each faction will work towards their current goal.

**Roll d6**, then adjust the value:

For each **relevant resource** the faction has, **add 1** to the result.

If a rival faction is targeted by the goal, **subtract 1** from the result for each of that faction’s **relevant resources**.

- On final result of **4-5**, mark **1 progress** toward the goal.
- On a **6+**, mark **2 progress**.

When a faction **completes a goal**, add a **new resource** to represent their increased power and influence.

If the goal reduces another faction’s power and influence, remove or change one of its resources.

As factions work towards and complete their goals, update your **map** to show waxing and waning power, and add hints of current goals to your **rumour table**.

### Player interference

As the players interact with factions, show **signs** of the **current goals** they are working towards.

Players should have opportunities to interact with the factions, to thwart or help them compete their goals.

Factions may attempt to recruit the help of players and players may interfere with the faction’s progress.

If the players successfully **help or interfere** in completion of a goal, mark or erase **1-3 progress marks**, depending on the scale of the player interference.

If players directly attack a faction and significantly affect their power, this may require you to remove or re-write a faction’s resource.

# Adventure site toolbox

## Creating an adventure site

Adventure sites are those dangerous places that only the bravest of mouse adventurers dare to scurry. They form the core of most Mausritter adventures.

Designing a good adventure site is more art than science, but these steps will help as a basic guide.

Use the [Adventure Site Generator to create an instant adventure](https://mausritter.com/adventure-site)!

### 1. Create a theme

The theme of the adventure site is the overall idea that guides its creation. Think of it like the title card and one-sentence description that will guide the rest of your choices.

### 2. Choose factions and goals

A good adventure site will be populated with at least two factions of creatures. These are not necessarily the factions working at your hexcrawl level, though these should inform your choices. The factions should have competing goals they are trying to achieve within the adventure site. Not all of the creatures within the adventure site will be part of these factions.

One of the factions in the site may already be clear from rolling the Denizens in the adventure site overview. The other faction could be protecting the site from that faction, or competing for a similar goal.

### 3. Draw a map

Draw or find a map of the location, then divide it into ‘rooms’ — these can be actual rooms, or just sensible dividing lines within a larger space.

The map doesn’t have to be pretty, detailed or to scale. You can just draw the rooms with boxes, and connect them with lines.

Keep these principles in mind when creating a map:

- **Multiple paths** give the players decision points while navigating the space. Create loops and links to other paths.
- **Varied paths** create distinct areas within the site. Stairs, ramps and cliffs break up the flow of a level and create more variety when navigating the space. Secrets paths reward players who are paying close attention.
- **Multiple entrances**, (even hidden ones) create opportunities to approach problems from a different angle.
- **History and ruination** have dramatic impacts on a space. Hint at changes left by previous inhabitants.

### 4. Stock rooms

For each room within the adventure site, roll or choose the type and contents. A good adventure site will provide a diverse set of challenges through a variety of room types. Some rooms will be obvious, so just go with what seems right. Others may need some random prodding.

### 5. Create an encounter table

Based on the factions you’ve chosen, and the rooms stocked, create a table of d6 encounters for the adventure site.
Encounters can be dangerous, but are not necessarily hostile to the player mice. Give each entry something it is already doing as the players arrive.

- Entries 1-3 should be variations of a common encounter.
- Entries 4-5 should be variations of an uncommon encounter, something slightly unusual.
- Entry 6 should be a strange or dangerous encounter.

| --- | -------- |
| 1-2 | Empty    |
| 3   | Obstacle |
| 4   | Trap     |
| 5   | Puzzle   |
| 6   | Lair     |

| 6   |       |          |      |        |      |

### Creatures and lairs

The creatures used in your adventure site should be populated from the factions you’ve already chosen, but don’t be afraid to include some other creatures too. Creatures not in a lair should have a reason for being the room where they are found.

| d6  | Lair                                  |
| --- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Temporary encampment                  |
| 2   | Recently taken from another creature  |
| 3   | Built by mice to hold the creature    |
| 4   | Protecting young                      |
| 5   | Permanent home, newly settled         |
| 6   | Permanent home, comfortably appointed |

### Empty rooms

Empty rooms provide mice with a chance to catch their breath and prepare for the next challenge.

| d20 | Empty room feature                           |
| --- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Abandoned insect nest                        |

| 9   | Overgrown with moss                          |
| 10  | Painted mural, now faded                     |
| 11  | Platforms hanging over rapidly flowing water |

| 15  | Shiny candy-wrapper banners                  |
| 16  | Snake skull doorway                          |
| 17  | Steady drip of water from ceiling            |
| 18  | Stern statue of an ancient mouse             |
| 19  | Uneven and deeply cracked floor              |
| 20  | White quartz altar                           |

### Obstacles

Obstacles are a barrier that must be bypassed by players to continue. Use up the players resources, highlight special equipment or push them to explore further.

| d8  | Obstacle                                                                                                          |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Locked door. Key can be found in another room. Knocking the door down takes time and makes noise.                 |
| 2   | Steep climb. Without special equipment, mice risk exhaustion or falling.                                          |
| 3   | Room with an exit in the centre of the roof, 6" away from any wall.                                               |
| 4   | Device that creates an high-pitched scream. Each Turn spent here or in adjacent rooms gives Frightened Condition. |
| 5   | Caved-in section of tunnel, leaving a gap too small to crawl through.                                             |
| 6   | Tunnel completely filled with water.                                                                              |
| 7   | Wide, deep puddle of mud blocking the way. Gives an Exhausted Condition per 6" traveled.                          |
| 8   | Long, smooth, upwards sloping metal or plastic tube.                                                              |

### Traps

Traps should be obvious and deadly. A good trap has a clear danger and multiple, non-obvious solutions. Consider the purpose the trap was built for, and how it is navigated by other creatures in the site. If the players use a risky method to bypass the trap, call for a Save or Luck roll.

| d8  | Trap                                                                                                                    |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Large stone door, chiseled loose from frame. Device behind the door tips it forward when handle is turned.              |
| 2   | Long hallway flooded with water, electrified by large battery in an alcove.                                             |
| 3   | Dark room filled with noxious, explosive gas. Distinct smell of rotten eggs. d20 damage if ignited.                     |
| 4   | Thin thread stretched across deadly fall. Safe if traveling slowly, one at a time.                                      |
| 5   | Pit blocking the way. A snake is asleep at the bottom.                                                                  |
| 6   | Door with three handles in the shape of mushrooms, one safe, the others poison. Poison handles deal d12 magical damage. |
| 7   | Circle of enchanted mushrooms, with a young mouse inside. Those within try desperately to get others to enter.          |
| 8   | Floor is covered in sticky glue. Requires a STR save to break a foot loose.                                             |

### Puzzles

Puzzles reward clever thinking. Give the players something to explore and experiment with. This could be a dangerous device, but one the players are able to exploit for their own purposes.

| d6  | Puzzle                                                                                                                    |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Room with a floor made of an electrified copper plate. A piece of valuable treasure sits in the centre.                   |
| 2   | Three feeding bottles with different-colored liquid inside. Each is inert individually but powerful/dangerous when mixed. |
| 3   | A crystal, a magic sword embedded inside. The crystal is very hard, but will dissolve in stomach acid.                    |
| 4   | Treasure is at the bottom of deep well.                                                                                   |
| 5   | Large smooth steel bowl, upside down. Treasure taped to the inside ceiling of the bowl.                                   |
| 6   | Baited mousetrap. The lever is wired to a stone in the wall and will collapse the corridor if triggered                   |

## Treasure

Valuable treasure is rarely left lying around. It may be defended, hidden or lost. Keep in mind where it came from and what left it there (and may miss it if taken).

When placing a treasure horde, roll to see what it holds.

Roll d20 twice on the **Treasure** table, plus an additional d20 for each of the following questions that are true:

- In a **former** mouse **settlement**, **castle** or dungeon?

### Cursed swords

Magic swords have a **1-in-6 chance** of being cursed.

Cursed swords **bind** to the mouse who **first holds** them, and **cannot be removed** from the mouse’s inventory.

While the curse remains, the sword has **no beneficial power**. Once lifted, the sword **regains** its power.

Declaring compatibility with Mausritter is distinct from using the Mausritter SRD. You can create content that is compatible with Mausritter without using the Mausritter SRD text, as long as you follow the terms of the Mausritter Third Party Licence.
