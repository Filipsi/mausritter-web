You will need to be very brave, and always keep your wits about you.\n\nUse these procedures to create a new mouse adventurer, or use the [instant mouse generator](https://mausritter.com/mouse) for even faster character creation.\n\n## 1. Attributes\n\nYour mouse has three attribute scores. These measure their basic strengths and weaknesses.\n\n- **STR:** physical strength and resilience.\n- **DEX:** speed and agility.\n- **WIL:** strength of will and charisma.\n\nFor each of these attributes, in order, roll **3d6**.\n\nKeep the **two highest dice** results for a value between 2—12.\n\nYou may then swap any two attributes.\n\n## 2. HP, pips and background\n\n**Roll d6** for your **Hit Protection** (HP). This is the damage your mouse can shrug off before taking serious harm.\n\n**Roll d6** for your mouse’s starting **pips**. These are the basic currency of the mouse kingdom.\n\n**Cross reference** the value of your **HP** with your **pips** on the **Background table**. This is what your mouse was before becoming an adventurer.\n\n## 3. Starting equipment\n\nYour mouse starts with:\n\n- **Torches**\n- **Rations**\n- Two items from their **background**\n- A **weapon** of your choice (see p. 9)\n\nIf your mouse’s highest attribute is 9 or less, roll on the Background table again and take either Item A or B. If your highest is 7 or less, take both.\n\n## 4. Details\n\nRoll or choose **birthsign**, **coat** and a **physical detail**.\n\nChoose a **name** appropriate for a brave mouse.\n\n## Backgrounds\n\n| HP  | Pips | Background        | Item A                         | Item B                    |\n| --- | ---- | ----------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- |\n| 1   | 1    | Test subject      | Spell: Magic missile
