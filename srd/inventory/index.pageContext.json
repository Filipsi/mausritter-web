Most items take up one inventory slot. Some larger items, such as two-handed weapons and armour take up two slots.\n\n### Paw slots\n\nYour mouse has two paw slots.\n\nItems in these slots are carried.\n\n### Body slots\n\nYour mouse has two body slots.\n\nWorn items can be swapped with paw slots as a free action.\n\n### Pack slots\n\nYour mouse has six body slots.\n\nItems in these slots take time to retrieve when under pressure. While in combat, your mouse must use an action (instead of attacking) to find an item in their pack.\n\n## Conditions\n\nConditions are **negative effects** suffered by your mouse. Each Condition must be placed in an **inventory slot**. Mice may have multiple copies of the same condition.\n\nSome Conditions have additional effects, which apply as long as the Condition remains in your inventory.\n\nConditions can only be **removed** by meeting their **clear** requirement—usually a short, long or full rest.\n\n## Usage\n\nMost items have three **usage dots**. When all three dots are marked on an item it is depleted or destroyed. Usage dots can be cleared from weapons/armour for 10% of the original cost per dot cleared.\n\n- **Weapons/armour/ammunition:** after a fight, roll d6 for each item that was used during the fight. On 4-6, mark usage.\n- **Torches/lanterns:** mark usage every 6 Turns.\n- **Rations:** mark usage after a meal.\n- **Other gear:** if used in a way that could break or deplete it, the GM may ask you to mark usage.\n\n## Encumbrance\n\nIf your mouse is carrying more items or Conditions than available inventory slots, they are **encumbered**.\n\nWhile encumbered, your mouse cannot **run**, and makes all saves with **Disadvantage**.\n\n## Banking\n\nIn a mouse settlement, pips and items can be stored in a bank or safebox.\n\nYour mouse must pay a fee of 1% of the value when retrieving the stored pips or items.\n\n## Weapons\n\n### Melee weapons\n\n#### Improvised\n\n**d6 damage**  \nWielded in: Main paw/both paws  \nSpecial rule: Always mark usage after a fight.\n\n#### Light\n\n**d6 damage**  \nWielded in: Main paw/off paw  \nSpecial rule: If attacking with two weapons, roll both dice and use the best result.  \nExample: Needle, dagger, hatchet\n\nCost: 10p\n\n#### Medium\n\n**d6/d8 damage**  \nWielded in: Main paw/both paws  \nSpecial rule: Does d6 damage in one paw, d8 wielded in both.  \nExample: Sword, axe, staff\n\nCost: 20p\n\n#### Heavy\n\n**d10 damage**  \nWielded in: Both paws  \nExample: Trashhook, spear, heavy hammer\n\nCost: 40p\n\n### Ranged weapons\n\n#### Light ranged\n\n**d6 damage**  \nWielded in: Main paw  \nExample: Sling, light crossbow\n\nCost: 10p\n\n#### Heavy ranged\n\n**d8 damage**  \nWielded in: Both paws  \nExample: Bow, heavy crossbow\n\nCost: 40p\n\n### Ammunition\n\n#### Stones, pouch\n\nCarried in: Body slot\n\nCost: 1p\n\n#### Arrows, quiver\n\nCarried in: Body slot\n\nCost: 5p\n\n## Armour\n\nReduces damage dealt to your mouse by enemy attacks.\n\n### Light armour\n\n**Prevents 1 damage**  \nWorn in: Off paw and one body slot\n\nCost: 150p\n\n### Heavy armour\n\n**Prevents 1 damage**  \nWorn in: Two body slots\n\nCost: 150p\n\n## Essential items\n\n### Torches and lanterns\n\n**Provide light**\n\nLight sources mark usage every 6 Turns.\n\nLanterns must be refilled by oil.\n\nElectric lanterns must be recharged by batteries, but provide 6 usage dots instead of 3.\n\n### Rations\n\n**Food for the road**\n\nEating a ration and spending a Watch resting will heal all HP.\n\nIf your mouse doesn’t eat for a day, they gain a Hungry Condition.\n\n### Pip purse\n\n**Holds 250 pips**\n\nCarried pips require one inventory slot per 250, barring the first 250, which are carried in your mouse’s pockets.\n\nMice in settlements mostly deal in barter and IOUs, and pips can be stored at a bank.\n","filename":"12-inventory.md"},"downloadUrl":"/srd/mausritter-srd-2.3.md"}}
