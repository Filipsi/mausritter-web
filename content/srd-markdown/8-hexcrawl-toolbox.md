# Hexcrawl toolbox

## Making a hexcrawl

### 1. Fill hexes

Start with a 5x5 map of **one-mile hexes**. Place a friendly **settlement** in the centre.

Fill the remaining hexes. Roll on the **hex contents** tables or use them as inspiration. Write a one-line description for each hex.

### 2. Create factions (Optional)

**Factions** are the major powers within your hex crawl. They help set the stakes of the players choices, and create the feeling of a living world going on outside of the game sessions.

### 3. Detail adventure sites

**Adventure sites** are the dangerous places where brave adventurers find the wealth they seek. Where settled mice, more careful and less desperate, do not dare to scurry.

Pick 2-4 of the of the landmarks and detail them as adventure sites. Spread them out, to give the players good reasons to criss-cross the map.

Decide the **theme** for each, then **fully detail** one of them. You can detail the others now, or wait until the players are closer to encountering them.

### 4. Seed rumours

Create a table of **d6 rumours**. As the players explore adventure sites or rest in settlements, use this table to give **hints** of other locations and of the activities of factions within the hexcrawl.

- Entries 1-3 should be true
- Entries 4-5 should partially true
- Entry 6 should be false

### 5. Create encounter table

Based on the factions you’ve chosen and other inhabitants of the area, create a table of **d6 encounters**.

## Running a hexcrawl

### First session

In the first session, pick one of the adventure sites you’ve detailed and start the players at the entrance.

Give the players a reason why they should care about the adventure site. Use the backgrounds of their mice and theme of the adventure site as hooks, or use the table below if you’re stuck for ideas.

| d6 | Starting adventure site hook                      |
|----|---------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Searching for a lost family member                |
| 2  | Investigating on orders of a noblemouse           |
| 3  | Mouse wizard requires a certain spell component   |
| 4  | Site is lair of a creature harassing a settlement |
| 5  | Following an inherited treasure map               |
| 6  | Seeking shelter from a terrible storm             |

### Exploring the map

Once the players are done exploring the adventure site, or need to retreat back to a friendly place for supplies, show them a **blank version** of your map.

Mark the **friendly settlement** and the **adventure site**, plus a couple of other well-known places.

Allow the players to find their own way through the map. As the party of mice move through each hex, they should automatically encounter the major landmarks you’ve created, as long as they are fairly obvious.

### Expanding the map

As the players uncover new leads and the world changes around them, create some more adventure sites and start expanding the map.

## Hex contents

For each hex on your map, roll, choose or invent:

- Hex type
- Landmark (depending on hex type)
- An interesting detail for that landmark

Write a one-line description for each hex.

### Hex type

|   d6   |   Type         |

## Mouse settlements

### Settlement size

Most mouse settlements are no more than a handful of families in an oak hollow or in an old farmhouse wall.

Roll 2d6 and use the lowest value.

|   d6  |   Size                       |
|-------|------------------------------|
|   1   |   Farm/manor (1-3 families)  |
|   2   |   Crossroads (3-5 families)  |
|   3   |   Hamlet (50-150 mice)       |
|   4   |   Village (150-300 mice)     |
|   5   |   Town (300-1000 mice)       |
|   6   |   City (1000+ mice)          |


### Governance

Most settlements pay taxes to (and are protected by) the local noblemouse. Free settlements keep their own guard.

Roll d6 + Settlement size (1 for Farm, 6 for City)

|   d6+    |   Size                                                 |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------|

|   4-5    |   Administered by a knight or lower-caste lord         |
|   6-7    |   Organised by a guild committee                       |
|   8-9    |   Free settlement, governed by council of burghermice  |
|   10-11  |   House of an upper caste noblemouse                   |
|   12     |   Seat of baronial power                               |

## Factions

Factions are **large forces** outside the control of the player mice. They help create a feeling of a **living world**.

Pick or create 3-4 factions to be the major powers within your hexcrawl.

### Using factions

Factions have goals they are trying to complete and resources they can utilise towards the goal’s completion. Goals should interact with other factions or complete for similar resources.

**Resources** reflect the power and influence of the faction within the world.

Each **goal** requires 2-5 progress marks (eg. ○○) to be completed, depending on its complexity.

Factions with at least three resources are capable of fielding a warband.

### Goal progression

**Between sessions**, each faction will work towards their current goal.

**Roll d6**, then adjust the value:

For each **relevant resource** the faction has, **add 1** to the result.

If a rival faction is targeted by the goal, **subtract 1** from the result for each of that faction’s **relevant resources**.

- On final result of **4-5**, mark **1 progress** toward the goal.
- On a **6+**, mark **2 progress**.

When a faction **completes a goal**, add a **new resource** to represent their increased power and influence.

If the goal reduces another faction’s power and influence, remove or change one of its resources.

As factions work towards and complete their goals, update your **map** to show waxing and waning power, and add hints of current goals to your **rumour table**.

### Player interference

As the players interact with factions, show **signs** of the **current goals** they are working towards.

Players should have opportunities to interact with the factions, to thwart or help them compete their goals.

Factions may attempt to recruit the help of players and players may interfere with the faction’s progress.

If the players successfully **help or interfere** in completion of a goal, mark or erase **1-3 progress marks**, depending on the scale of the player interference.

If players directly attack a faction and significantly affect their power, this may require you to remove or re-write a faction’s resource.
