# Inventory

## Inventory slots

Your mouse carries items in their inventory slots. Most items take up one inventory slot. Some larger items, such as two-handed weapons and armour take up two slots.

### Paw slots

Your mouse has two paw slots.

Items in these slots are carried.

### Body slots

Your mouse has two body slots.

Worn items can be swapped with paw slots as a free action.

### Pack slots

Your mouse has six body slots.

Items in these slots take time to retrieve when under pressure. While in combat, your mouse must use an action (instead of attacking) to find an item in their pack.

## Conditions

Conditions are **negative effects** suffered by your mouse.

Each Condition must be placed in an **inventory slot**. Mice may have multiple copies of the same condition.

Some Conditions have additional effects, which apply as long as the Condition remains in your inventory.

Conditions can only be **removed** by meeting their **clear** requirement—usually a short, long or full rest.

## Usage

Most items have three **usage dots**. When all three dots are marked on an item it is depleted or destroyed. Usage dots can be cleared from weapons/armour for 10% of the original cost per dot cleared.

- **Weapons/armour/ammunition:** after a fight, roll d6 for each item that was used during the fight. On 4-6, mark usage.
- **Torches/lanterns:** mark usage every 6 Turns.
- **Rations:** mark usage after a meal.
- **Other gear:** if used in a way that could break or deplete it, the GM may ask you to mark usage.

### Pip purse

Mice in settlements mostly deal in barter and IOUs, and pips can be stored at a bank.
