# Creatures

## Language

As a general rule of thumb, the more closely related two creatures are, the more likely they are to understand each other. Magical or highly intelligent creatures may break these rules.

- Other mice: Can easily communicate.
- Other rodents: Can speak and communicate, with some difficulty and difference of custom.
- Other mammals: Make a WIL save to see if  communication is possible.
- Otherwise: Can’t directly communicate.


## List of creatures

Use these creatures in your campaign, and as examples for creating new antagonists for your players.

When a creature lists critical damage in its stat block, this occurs instead of the standard critical damage effect.

> Example: a spider attacks Burdock the mouse and does 4 damage. The Burdock has 2 HP, so 2 of the damage is passed through to his DEX. Burdock must make a DEX Save, but fails, so the spider quickly wraps the him up in its web and starts to escape. Hopefully Burdock’s friends are quick in their pursuit!
