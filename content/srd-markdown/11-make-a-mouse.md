# Make a mouse

The world is very big and very dangerous for a small mouse adventurer. You will need to be very brave, and always keep your wits about you.

Use these procedures to create a new mouse adventurer, or use the [instant mouse generator](/mouse) for even faster character creation.

## 1. Attributes

Your mouse has three attribute scores. These measure their basic strengths and weaknesses.

- **STR:** physical strength and resilience.
- **DEX:** speed and agility.
- **WIL:** strength of will and charisma.

For each of these attributes, in order, roll **3d6**.

Keep the **two highest dice** results for a value between 2—12.

You may then swap any two attributes.

## 2. HP, pips and background

**Roll d6** for your **Hit Protection** (HP). This is the damage your mouse can shrug off before taking serious harm.

**Roll d6** for your mouse’s starting **pips**. These are the basic currency of the mouse kingdom.

**Cross reference** the value of your **HP** with your **pips** on the **Background table**. This is what your mouse was before becoming an adventurer.

## 3. Starting equipment

Your mouse starts with:

- **Torches**
- **Rations**
- Two items from their **background**
- A **weapon** of your choice (see p. 9)

If your mouse’s highest attribute is 9 or less, roll on the Background table again and take either Item A or B. If your highest is 7 or less, take both.

## 4. Details

Roll or choose **birthsign**, **coat** and a **physical detail**.

Choose a **name** appropriate for a brave mouse.
