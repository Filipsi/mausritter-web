## Spells

Spells are living spirits trapped by runes carved on obsidian tablets. Spells are usually found in deep and dangerous places. The creation of spells is an art lost to all but the most learned wizards, and they guard their secrets closely.

### Selling spells

If unwanted, a fully charged spell can usually be sold for d6 x 100p in a settlement. A depleted spell’s value is halved.

### Casting a spell

To cast a spell, your mouse must hold the tablet in a paw and read it aloud.

When your mouse casts a spell, decide on the **power** to cast it with, up to the number of usage dots remaining on the spell.

Roll a number of **d6** equal to the **power** the spell is cast with. For each die which shows the **value 4, 5 or 6**, mark one usage on the spell.

The spell has an **effect**, which varies depending on the number of **[DICE]** invested, and the **[SUM]** of the rolled dice.

### Recharging a spell

When a spell’s usage dots are filled, it is **depleted** and cannot be cast. Each spell has a **recharge requirement**. Fulfilling this requirement will coax the spirit back to the spell and **clear all** of its usage dots.

### Miscasts

Whenever **one or more 6s** are rolled when casting a spell, the caster takes **d6 damage to WIL** for each 6 rolled. Then make a WIL save. If failed, take the **Mad** Condition.
