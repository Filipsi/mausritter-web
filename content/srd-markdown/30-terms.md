# Terms of use

## Mausritter SRD Licence

The text of the **Mausritter System Reference Document** (SRD) is licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). This means you can use, copy, and modify the rules, mechanics, and text of the Mausritter SRD in your own works, as long as you follow the terms outlined below.

### Attribution

When using the Mausritter SRD text, you must include the following attribution in your work:

> This work is based on [Mausritter](https://mausritter.com), a product of Losing Games and Isaac Williams, and is licensed for use under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) licence.

The attribution must be included in a prominent location, such as the credits or introduction of your work.

### Copying

You can copy and use the Mausritter SRD text in your own works, including commercial products, as long as you provide proper attribution. 

### Translation

This licence allows you to translate the Mausritter SRD text into other languages.

The Mausritter book, illustrations and other materials that are not part of the SRD are **not covered by this licence**. You may not copy or translate them for publication without explicit permission from Losing Games. Contact [Isaac Williams](https://isaacwilliams.net) for details on licensing Mausritter for translation.


### Endorsement

You must not state or imply that your work is an official Mausritter product, or that it is endorsed by Losing Games or Games Omnivorous, unless you have explicit permission to do so.

## Third Party Licence

Creating adventures, supplements, and other content for Mausritter is allowed under the [Mausritter Third Party Licence](/third-party-licence). This licence allows you to create and sell your own Mausritter content while adhering to the terms outlined on that page.

If you do so, you may use the "Compatible with Mausritter" logo in your work (but are not required to do so).

Declaring compatibility with Mausritter is distinct from using the Mausritter SRD. You can create content that is compatible with Mausritter without using the Mausritter SRD text, as long as you follow the terms of the Mausritter Third Party Licence.
