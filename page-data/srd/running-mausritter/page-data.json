Be on the lookout for opportunities to remind the players of the <strong>small-scale characters</strong> they are playing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"create-situations-not-plots\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#create-situations-not-plots\" aria-label=\"create situations not plots permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"></a>Create situations, not plots</h3>\n<p>Let the players <strong>find their own adventure</strong>. Don’t railroad them onto a particular path. Give the players the space to choose the challenges they are interested in.</p>\n<h3 id=\"present-the-world-honestly\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#present-the-world-honestly\" aria-label=\"present the world honestly permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"></a>Present the world honestly</h3>\n<p>As the GM, you are the <strong>eyes, ears and nose</strong> of the players and their mice. Don’t unnecessarily hide things from your players. Make sure they have all the information they need to make meaningful choices.</p>\n<p>Make the world a <strong>consistent</strong>, understandable place. Don’t shy away from magic and weirdness, but maintain a logic behind it that can be decoded.</p>\n<p>Be an <strong>impartial arbiter</strong> of the rules of the game and the world. Let the dice fall as they may. Follow the goals and actions of antagonists to their logical conclusion.</p>\n<h3 id=\"telegraph-danger\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#telegraph-danger\" aria-label=\"telegraph danger permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"></a>Telegraph danger</h3>\n<p>Give the players ample <strong>warning</strong> of the <strong>dangers</strong> they face. Make traps obvious, deadly puzzles. Give warning of the dangerous beasts that hunt the mice.</p>\n<p>Don’t pull your punches.</p>\n<p>The only way for danger to be meaningful is if the outcome of failure is meaningful. When the players face off against dangerous foes, or fall into a deadly trap, do not shy away from the consequences.</p>\n<h3 id=\"reward-bravery\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#reward-bravery\" aria-label=\"reward bravery permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"></a>Reward bravery</h3>\n<p>When the players have been smart and brave and followed good leads, give them the <strong>rewards</strong> they have earned. Don’t be miserly when the players face down great dangers and succeed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"asking-for-a-save\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#asking-for-a-save\" aria-label=\"asking for a save permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"></a>Asking for a Save</h2>\n<p>Saves should only be asked for as the result of a player’s action or choice. Mice can do anything that seems reasonable and safe, but when they do something dangerous, ask for Save to avoid the possible consequences.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>STR Saves:</strong> avoid harm through physical power and endurance</li>\n<li><strong>DEX Saves:</strong> avoid harm through quick reaction, speed and agility</li>\n<li><strong>WIL Saves:</strong> avoid harm through strength of will and force of personality</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"consequences-of-failure\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#consequences-of-failure\" aria-label=\"consequences of failure permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"></a>Consequences of failure</h3>\n<p>The consequences of a failed Save should obvious and telegraphed. Remember that Saves should only occur when a player wants to avoid a negative outcome.</p>\n<p>Some options for consequences are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Damage:</strong> ranging from d4 to d20. d4 is minor, d6 is dangerous. d8 is enough to seriously injure a Level 1 character. d20 damage is rare but deadly.</li>\n<li><strong>Condition:</strong> Exhausted or Frightened are good options.</li>\n<li><strong>Lost time:</strong> Each action takes a Turn. Lost time can burn torches and cause random encounter rolls.</li>\n<li><strong>Loss of random item:</strong> Roll d6 for inventory slot.</li>\n<li><strong>Mark usage on item:</strong> Mark 1-3 usage dots.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"luck-rolls\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#luck-rolls\" aria-label=\"luck rolls permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"></a>Luck rolls</h2>\n<p>Luck rolls are for events that have an unpredictable outcome is outside the remit of a STR, DEX or WIL Save. Assign an ‘X-in-6’ chance to the outcome occurring (low for unlikely, high for likely), then roll a d6. If the result is equal to or less than the chance, it happens.</p>\n<h2 id=\"rulings\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#rulings\" aria-label=\"rulings permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"></a>Rulings</h2>\n<p>The rules of Mausritter will not cover every situation you and the players come across, and some parts have been kept intentionally vague.</p>\n<p>When this happens, <strong>adapt</strong> one of your existing tools to the purpose, or <strong>create</strong> a new one. Make a note of the ruling for future use.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exploration-and-time\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#exploration-and-time\" aria-label=\"exploration and time permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"></a>Exploration and time</h2>\n<p>When <strong>exploring</strong> in a dungeon or <strong>adventure site</strong>, a party of mice can perform <strong>one major action per Turn</strong>. Major actions are things like moving to a new room, examining a trap or engaging in a fight.</p>\n<p>To easily record Turns, use the <strong>Turn tracker</strong> on the GM Session sheet. Each time the party performs a major action, mark the next empty box. When a double-outlined box is marked, roll for an encounter.</p>\n<h2 id=\"overland-travel\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#overland-travel\" aria-label=\"overland travel permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"></a>Overland travel</h2>\n<p>When traveling in the wilderness, the mice can travel a single one-mile hex per Watch. Hexes containing difficult terrain (streams, human roads, large rocks, hills, etc.) require two Watches to cross.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rest\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#rest\" aria-label=\"rest permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"></a>Rest</h3>\n<p>If the mice do not spend at least one Watch per day resting, give them an Exhausted Condition.</p>\n<h3 id=\"weather\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#weather\" aria-label=\"weather permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"></a>Weather</h3>\n<p>Roll 2d6 for weather each day.</p>\n<p>Weather that is highlighted are poor conditions for travel. For each Watch spent traveling under these conditions, a mouse must make a STR save or gain an Exhausted Condition.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>2d6</th>\n<th>Spring</th>\n<th>Summer</th>\n<th>Autumn</th>\n<th>Winter</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Rain  storm</td>\n<td>Thunder  storm</td>\n<td>Wild winds</td>\n<td>Snow  storm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3-5</td>\n<td>Drizzle</td>\n<td>Very hot</td>\n<td>Heavy rain</td>\n<td>Sleet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6-8</td>\n<td>Overcast</td>\n<td>Clear, hot</td>\n<td>Cool</td>\n<td>Bitter  cold</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9-11</td>\n<td>Bright and sunny</td>\n<td>Pleasantly sunny</td>\n<td>Patchy rain</td>\n<td>Overcast</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>Clear and warm</td>\n<td>Beautifully warm</td>\n<td>Clear and crisp</td>\n<td>Clear and crisp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"encounters\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#encounters\" aria-label=\"encounters permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"></a>Encounters</h2>\n<p>When the mice are exploring a dungeon or <strong>adventure site</strong>, roll for encounters <strong>every three Turns</strong>, or whenever they create noise or mayhem that could draw attention.</p>\n<p>When they are exploring the <strong>wilderness</strong>, roll for encounters at the start of the <strong>Morning</strong> Watch and the start of the <strong>Evening</strong> watch. If an encounter occurs, roll d12 to find what hour it occurs in.</p>\n<p>To roll a random encounter, <strong>roll d6</strong>. On a 1, an <strong>encounter</strong> occurs. On a 2, an <strong>omen</strong> occurs (signs or hints of an encounter).</p>\n<h3 id=\"encounter-tables\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#encounter-tables\" aria-label=\"encounter tables permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"></a>Encounter tables</h3>\n<p>For each major area, prepare a table of d6 encounters that express the theme of that area.
