You and between two and five friends play make-believe to create a shared world. The rules help keep the story you tell consistent, interesting and challenging.</p>\n<p>One of you will take on the role of the Game Master (GM). They will invent and describe a consistent, believable world, complete with dangerous antagonists, wild lands, and friendly settlements. They will also act as a neutral referee of the rules, applying them fairly to player mice, along with the non-player characters within the world.</p>\n<p>The other players take on the role of the mice. They each play the role of a small, brave and desperate adventurer, delving into dangerous places and exploring the world that the GM describes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-a-role-playing-game\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-is-a-role-playing-game\" aria-label=\"what is a role playing game permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"></a>What is a role-playing game?</h3>\n<p>Role-playing games are a process of shared, collaborative storytelling and problem solving.\nRole-playing games exist mostly as a conversation. The GM will describe a situation, and the players will describe how the mice they control react and interact with it.</p>\n<p>At certain points (such as when a mouse does something risky), the rules of the game interject. Dice may be rolled to see what happens. Then the conversation resumes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-you-need-to-play\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-you-need-to-play\" aria-label=\"what you need to play permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"></a>What you need to play</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A character sheet for each player</li>\n<li>A session tracking sheet for the Game Master</li>\n<li>A set of Item and Condition tokens</li>\n<li>Polyhedral gaming dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 and d20)</li>\n<li>Pencils and erasers</li>\n<li>Spare paper for taking notes and sketching maps</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"dice-notation\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#dice-notation\" aria-label=\"dice notation permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"></a>Dice notation</h3>\n<p>Mausritter uses standard RPG dice notation throughout.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>d20 means: Roll a single 20-sided die</li>\n<li>1d8 means: Roll a single 8-sided die</li>\n<li>3d6 means: Roll three 6-sided dice, add them together</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For a d3 or d2, roll a 6-sided die and divide by two or three.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":"brave-mice-dangerous-world","title":"Brave mice in a dangerous world"}},"toc":{"edges":[{"node":{"markdown":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Brave mice in a dangerous world","section":"Player rules","slug":"brave-mice-dangerous-world"}}}},{"node":{"markdown":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Make a mouse","section":"Player rules","slug":"make-a-mouse"}}}},{"node":{"markdown":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Inventory","section":"Player rules","slug":"inventory"}}}},{"node":{"markdown":{"frontmatter":{"title":"How to play","section":"Player rules","slug":"how-to-play"}}}},{"node":{"markdown":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Magic","section":"Player rules","slug":"magic"}}}},{"node":{"markdown":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Recruiting help","section":"Player rules","slug":"recruiting-help"}}}},{"node":{"markdown":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Running Mausritter","section":"GM rules and resources","slug":"running-mausritter"}}}},{"node":{"markdown":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Creatures","section":"GM rules and resources","slug":"creatures"}}}},{"node":{"markdown":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Hexcrawl toolbox","section":"GM rules and resources","slug":"hexcrawl-toolbox"}}}},{"node":{"markdown":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Adventure site toolbox","section":"GM rules and resources","slug":"adventure-site-toolbox"}}}},{"node":{"markdown":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Useful tables","section":"GM rules and resources","slug":"useful-tables"}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"title":"Brave mice in a dangerous world","section":"Player rules","slug":"brave-mice-dangerous-world"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3449107851"]}
