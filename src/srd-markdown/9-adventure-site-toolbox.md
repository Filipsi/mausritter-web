## Creating an adventure site

Adventure sites are those dangerous places that only the bravest of mouse adventurers dare to scurry. They form the core of most Mausritter adventures.

Designing a good adventure site is more art than science, but these steps will help as a basic guide.

### 1. Create a theme

The theme of the adventure site is the overall idea that guides its creation. Think of it like the title card and one-sentence description that will guide the rest of your choices.

### 2. Choose factions and goals

A good adventure site will be populated with at least two factions of creatures. These are not necessarily the factions working at your hexcrawl level, though these should inform your choices. The factions should have competing goals they are trying to achieve within the adventure site. Not all of the creatures within the adventure site will be part of these factions.

One of the factions in the site may already be clear from rolling the Denizens in the adventure site overview. The other faction could be protecting the site from that faction, or competing for a similar goal.

### 3. Draw a map

Draw or find a map of the location, then divide it into ‘rooms’ — these can be actual rooms, or just sensible dividing lines within a larger space.

The map doesn’t have to be pretty, detailed or to scale. You can just draw the rooms with boxes, and connect them with lines.

Keep these principles in mind when creating a map:

- **Multiple paths** give the players decision points while navigating the space. Create loops and links to other paths.
- **Varied paths** create distinct areas within the site. Stairs, ramps and cliffs break up the flow of a level and create more variety when navigating the space. Secrets paths reward players who are paying close attention.
- **Multiple entrances**, (even hidden ones) create opportunities to approach problems from a different angle.
- **History and ruination** have dramatic impacts on a space. Hint at changes left by previous inhabitants.

### 4. Stock rooms

For each room within the adventure site, roll or choose the type and contents. A good adventure site will provide a diverse set of challenges through a variety of room types. Some rooms will be obvious, so just go with what seems right. Others may need some random prodding.

### 5. Create an encounter table

Based on the factions you’ve chosen, and the rooms stocked, create a table of d6 encounters for the adventure site.
Encounters can be dangerous, but are not necessarily hostile to the player mice. Give each entry something it is already doing as the players arrive.

- Entries 1-3 should be variations of a common encounter.
- Entries 4-5 should be variations of an uncommon encounter, something slightly unusual.
- Entry 6 should be a strange or dangerous encounter.

## Randomly stocking rooms

To randomly stock a room in an adventure site, roll d6 three times; the first result shows the room type, the second shows if a creature is present, and the third shows if treasure can be found here.

|        |   Room type  |   d6 Creature                           ||   d6 Treasure                            ||

|   3    |   Obstacle   |   X   |   X  |      |      |      |      |   X    |      |      |      |      |      |
|   4    |   Trap       |   X   |      |      |      |      |      |   X    |   X  |      |      |      |      |
|   5    |   Puzzle     |   X   |      |      |      |      |      |   X    |   X  |   X  |   X  |   X  |      |
|   6    |   Lair       |   X   |   X  |   X  |   X  |   X  |      |   X    |   X  |   X  |   X  |      |      |

### Creatures and lairs

The creatures used in your adventure site should be populated from the factions you’ve already chosen, but don’t be afraid to include some other creatures too. Creatures not in a lair should have a reason for being the room where they are found.

|   d6  |   Lair                                   |
|-------|------------------------------------------|

|   3   |   Built by mice to hold the creature     |
|   4   |   Protecting young                       |
|   5   |   Permanent home, newly settled          |
|   6   |   Permanent home, comfortably appointed  |


### Empty rooms

Empty rooms provide mice with a chance to catch their breath and prepare for the next challenge.

|   d20  |   Empty room feature                            |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------|
|   1    |   Abandoned insect nest                         |
|   2    |   Cluster of mushrooms                          |
|   3    |   Collapsed wall or ceiling                     |
|   4    |   Dried bug shells on the walls                 |
|   5    |   Furniture made of repurposed trash            |
|   6    |   Huge drawing of bat face on wall              |
|   7    |   Mess of tables and chairs                     |
|   8    |   Newspaper clipping wallpaper                  |
|   9    |   Overgrown with moss                           |
|   10   |   Painted mural, now faded                      |
|   11   |   Platforms hanging over rapidly flowing water  |
|   12   |   Roots bursting out of walls/floor/ceiling     |
|   13   |   Rotting pile of acorns                        |
|   14   |   Scattering of animal teeth                    |
|   15   |   Shiny candy-wrapper banners                   |
|   16   |   Snake skull doorway                           |
|   17   |   Steady drip of water from ceiling             |
|   18   |   Stern statue of an ancient mouse              |
|   19   |   Uneven and deeply cracked floor               |
|   20   |   White quartz altar                            |

### Obstacles

Obstacles are a barrier that must be bypassed by players to continue. Use up the players resources, highlight special equipment or push them to explore further.

|   d8  |   Obstacle                                                                                                           |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   1   |   Locked door. Key can be found in another room. Knocking the door down takes time and makes noise.                  |
|   2   |   Steep climb. Without special equipment, mice risk exhaustion or falling.                                           |
|   3   |   Room with an exit in the centre of the roof, 6" away from any wall.                                                |
|   4   |   Device that creates an high-pitched scream. Each Turn spent here or in adjacent rooms gives Frightened Condition.  |
|   5   |   Caved-in section of tunnel, leaving a gap too small to crawl through.                                              |
|   6   |   Tunnel completely filled with water.                                                                               |
|   7   |   Wide, deep puddle of mud blocking the way. Gives an Exhausted Condition per 6" traveled.                           |
|   8   |   Long, smooth, upwards sloping metal or plastic tube.                                                               |

### Traps

Traps should be obvious and deadly. A good trap has a clear danger and multiple, non-obvious solutions. Consider the purpose the trap was built for, and how it is navigated by other creatures in the site. If the players use a risky method to bypass the trap, call for a Save or Luck roll.

|   d8  |   Trap                                                                                                                     |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   1   |   Large stone door, chiseled loose from frame. Device behind the door tips it forward when handle is turned.               |
|   2   |   Long hallway flooded with water, electrified by large battery in an alcove.                                              |
|   3   |   Dark room filled with noxious, explosive gas. Distinct smell of rotten eggs. d20 damage if ignited.                      |
|   4   |   Thin thread stretched across deadly fall. Safe if traveling slowly, one at a time.                                       |
|   5   |   Pit blocking the way. A snake is asleep at the bottom.                                                                   |
|   6   |   Door with three handles in the shape of mushrooms, one safe, the others poison. Poison handles deal d12 magical damage.  |
|   7   |   Circle of enchanted mushrooms, with a young mouse inside. Those within try desperately to get others to enter.           |
|   8   |   Floor is covered in sticky glue. Requires a STR save to break a foot loose.                                              |

### Puzzles

Puzzles reward clever thinking. Give the players something to explore and experiment with. This could be a dangerous device, but one the players are able to exploit for their own purposes.

|   d6  |   Puzzle                                                                                                                     |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   1   |   Room with a floor made of an electrified copper plate. A piece of valuable treasure sits in the centre.                    |
|   2   |   Three feeding bottles with different-colored liquid inside. Each is inert individually but powerful/dangerous when mixed.  |
|   3   |   A crystal, a magic sword embedded inside. The crystal is very hard, but will dissolve in stomach acid.                     |
|   4   |   Treasure is at the bottom of deep well.                                                                                    |
|   5   |   Large smooth steel bowl, upside down. Treasure taped to the inside ceiling of the bowl.                                    |
|   6   |   Baited mousetrap. The lever is wired to a stone in the wall and will collapse the corridor if triggered                    |

## Treasure

Valuable treasure is rarely left lying around. It may be defended, hidden or lost. Keep in mind where it came from and what left it there (and may miss it if taken).

When placing a treasure horde, roll to see what it holds.

Roll d20 twice on the **Treasure** table, plus an additional d20 for each of the following questions that are true:

- In a **former** mouse **settlement**, **castle** or dungeon?
- In a **highly magical** area?
- Defended by a **great beast** or **devious trap**?
- The mice overcame **great adversity** to find it?

## Magic swords

Magic swords only **mark usage** when a 6 is rolled.

They can be **repaired** by a **highly skilled blacksmith**, or by an unusually **practically minded wizard**, a service that will require payment greater than simply pips.

### Cursed swords

Magic swords have a **1-in-6 chance** of being cursed.

Cursed swords **bind** to the mouse who **first holds** them, and **cannot be removed** from the mouse’s inventory.

While the curse remains, the sword has **no beneficial power**. Once lifted, the sword **regains** its power.
